# Aeolian Erosion in Partially Saturated Sand
This repository contains the replication of the numerical methodology described by Cavalcante & Zornberg (2017) for solving transient unsaturated flow problems.  
The current stage focuses on reproducing the formulation and structure of the model; the implementation of a coupled framework connecting soil moisture transients with the friction vthreshold velocity (FTV) is currently under development.

## Current Status
At this stage, the model reproduces the transient water flow in partially saturated sand based on the formulation by Cavalcante & Zornberg (2017).
The coupling with surface boundary conditions representing evaporation fluxes and the evaluation of the Friction Threshold Velocity (FTV) are planned for the next development phase.
